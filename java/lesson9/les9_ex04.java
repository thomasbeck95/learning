// Q4
// We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of 100) by student A and in four subjects
// (each out of 100) by student B.
//
// Create interface 'Marks' with an abstract method 'getPercentage'.

// It is implemented by two other classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method with the same name which returns the percentage
// of the students.
//
// The constructor of student A takes the marks in three subjects as its parameters and the marks in
// four subjects as its parameters for student B.
//
// Create an object for each of the two classes and print the percentage
// of marks for both the students.
